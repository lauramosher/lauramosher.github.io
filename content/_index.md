# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, hello!

I am an experienced software engineer across a variety of industries and disciplines. While my deepest focus is in Ruby and Rails, I also have extensive experience in Javascript, React, Go, and more.

I've worn many "hats" and filled many different roles, and where I am _happiest_ is when I am puzzling through problems and solving complex problems.

I am strong advocate for mental health and mental health advocacy in the workplace. I will both intentionally and unintentionally challenge the status quo in an effort to ensure that not only my needs are being met in the workplace, but those around me as well.

Currently, self-care looks like puzzles, LEGOÂ®, climbing boulders at my local climbing gym, and reading.
